
 Scala is a high level general purpose multi-paradigm programming language termed as better Java that is used to express the common programming patterns in a type-safe, concise and elegant way. Scala is a type-safe JVM language that easily integrates features of functional and object oriented programming languages. The JVM and JavaScript runtimes helps us to build high-performance systems with an easy access to huge ecosystems of libraries and provides support for developing highly concurrent applications.

A general-purpose, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language

Scala provides support for functional programming approach and purely object oriented language

There is no concept of primitive data as everything is an object in Scala

Scala programs can convert to bytecodes and run on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

Scala stands for scalable language and is highly influenced by Java and some other programming languages like Lisp, Haskell, Pizza etc.

There are two ways to write Scala code:

1.  As a Build-Compile-Run project using an IDE

2.  In the Scala REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop)


 The <- operator is called a generator. It generates individual values from a collection.

Now let us look at some variations in loops for the above problem.

For-loop with guard conditions: If-statements inside for-loops are called guard conditions.
